# Project 2 - *YipYap*

**YipYap** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **18** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Search results page
   - [X] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
   - [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
   - [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [X] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   - [X] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
   - [X] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   - [X] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   - [X] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [X] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Filter page
   - [ ] Implement a custom switch instead of the default UISwitch.
   - [ ] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   - [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is [here](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list).
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Further discussion about delegates. When adding the distance filter, understanding where and how to update all instances where the search function was invoked was not immediately apparent.
2. Discussion about syntax and style. Understanding good coding style would be really useful.


## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This homework was particularly challenging because of the complexity and the introduction of two fairly complex ideas in class. After watching the videos, AutoLayout became more understandable. In terms of the Filters video, I think that a high level overview of why we implemented the things that we did would be very useful for the homework but also for understanding. To be honest, I struggled through most of the homework (should have started earlier), but also would love to walk through delegate patterns again.
